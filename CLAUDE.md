# House of Rose — Working Memory

## Business
House of Rose is a luxury spa & wellness brand.
This is a **completely separate business from FAS Motorsports** — no shared infrastructure, no Medusa, no Vendure.

---

## Repo: house-of-rose-site
**Monorepo** at `~/LocalStorm/Workspace/DevProjects/house_of_rose/house-of-rose-site/`

| Package | Path | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `@house-of-rose/web` | `packages/web/` | Astro static site — customer-facing storefront |
| `@house-of-rose/studio` | `packages/studio/` | Sanity Studio v3 — content & product management |

---

## Architecture Law (Never Break)
- **Sanity owns everything**: services, products, site settings, content, images
- **No Medusa** — this is a spa, not a high-volume e-commerce store
- **No Vendure** — unrelated to FAS Motorsports ecosystem
- **Astro is static (`output: 'static'`)** — all data fetched at build time via GROQ
- **No React islands for now** — pure Astro components unless interactivity is explicitly needed

---

## Sanity Project
| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| Project ID | `4e7axyi7` |
| Dataset | `production` |
| API Version | `2025-04-26` |
| Studio URL | `http://localhost:3333` (local) |
| Organization | Amber (`ouLdbVxnh`) |

---

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Astro v5 (static output)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3 + `@tailwindcss/typography`
- **CMS**: Sanity v3 + GROQ
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict, no `any`)
- **Hosting**: TBD (Netlify recommended for static)

## Schemas (packages/studio/schemas/)
| Schema | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `siteSettings` | Singleton — site name, tagline, contact, social |
| `serviceCollection` | Groups of related services (e.g. "Facials", "Body") |
| `service` | Individual treatment — title, duration, price, image |
| `product` | Retail product — skincare, candles, gift cards |

---

## Routes (packages/web/src/pages/)
| Route | File | Data Source |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `/` | `index.astro` | All services + collections |
| `/services` | `services/index.astro` | All services |
| `/services/[slug]` | `services/[slug].astro` | Single service by slug |
| `/services/collections` | `services/collections/index.astro` | All collections |
| `/services/collections/[collection]` | `services/collections/[collection].astro` | Single collection |
| `/experience` | `experience.astro` | Static |

## Local Dev
```zsh
# Install (run from repo root)
npm install

# Astro frontend
npm run dev:web        # → http://localhost:4321

# Sanity Studio
npm run dev:studio     # → http://localhost:3333

# Build both
npm run build
```

## Env Vars
Local: `packages/web/.env.local` (gitignored — already populated with Sanity tokens)
Production: set in Netlify dashboard

| Variable | Used By | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` | web | `4e7axyi7` |
| `PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` | web | `production` |
| `PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION` | web | `2025-04-26` |

---

## Git Push Protocol
Use Desktop Commander (`mcp__Desktop_Commander__start_process`) to run `git push` — it executes as `ambermin` with Keychain access.

```zsh
cd ~/LocalStorm/Workspace/DevProjects/house_of_rose/house-of-rose-site && git push origin main
```

## Preferences
- Strict TypeScript — no `any`, use interfaces + generics
- GROQ queries live in `packages/web/src/lib/queries.ts`
- Sanity client/helpers live in `packages/web/src/lib/sanity.ts`
- Create files in place — don't just output code blocks
- Explain the *why* and *how*, skip pleasantries
