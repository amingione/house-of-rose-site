# House of Rose — Working Memory

## Business
House of Rose is a luxury spa & wellness brand.
This is a **completely separate business from FAS Motorsports** — no shared infrastructure, no Medusa, no Vendure.

---

## Repo: house-of-rose-site
**Monorepo** at `~/LocalStorm/Workspace/DevProjects/house_of_rose/house-of-rose-site/`

| Package | Path | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `@house-of-rose/web` | `packages/web/` | Astro static site — customer-facing storefront |
| `@house-of-rose/studio` | `packages/studio/` | Sanity Studio v3 — content & product management |

---

## Architecture Law (Never Break)
- **Sanity owns everything**: services, products, site settings, content, images
- **No Medusa** — this is a spa, not a high-volume e-commerce store
- **No Vendure** — unrelated to FAS Motorsports ecosystem
- **Astro is static (`output: 'static'`)** — all data fetched at build time via GROQ
- **No React islands for now** — pure Astro components unless interactivity is explicitly needed

---

## Netlify Sites

| Site | Netlify Name | Site ID | Custom Domain | Config |
|------|-------------|---------|---------------|--------|
| Storefront | `house-of-rose-web` | `0de4617d-5ba1-4e80-b59e-4900b540f5c0` | `houseofrosefl.com` | Base dir: `packages/web` → uses `packages/web/netlify.toml` |
| Studio | `house-of-rose-studio` | `44c4d348-8afd-4c0d-adb2-f8f9b7ffde15` | `studio.houseofrosefl.com` | No base dir → uses root `netlify.toml` |

**Netlify env vars set on `house-of-rose-web` (builds scope):**
- `PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` = `4e7axyi7`
- `PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` = `production`
- `PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION` = `2025-04-26`
- `SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN` = (secret — server-side lead submission writes, do not commit)
- `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` = `https://houseofrosefl.com`
- `PUBLIC_BOOKING_EMAIL` = `book@houseofrosefl.com`

**Netlify UI configuration:**
- **Studio site**: No base directory needed (uses root `netlify.toml`)
- **Web site**: Must set Base directory to `packages/web` in Site settings → Build & deploy → Base directory
- Both sites: Connect GitHub repo (`house-of-rose-site`) and configure custom domains

## Local Dev
```zsh
# Install (run from repo root)
npm install

# Astro frontend
npm run dev:web        # → http://localhost:4321

# Sanity Studio
npm run dev:studio     # → http://localhost:3333

# Build both
npm run build
```

---

## Env Vars
Local: `packages/web/.env.local` (gitignored — already populated with Sanity tokens)
Production: set in Netlify dashboard

| Variable | Used By | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` | web | `4e7axyi7` |
| `PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` | web | `production` |
| `PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION` | web | `2025-04-26` |
| `SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN` | web functions | Server-only — creates lead submissions, never expose to browser |

| `PUBLIC_BOOKING_EMAIL` | web | Used on Book Now `mailto:` links |

---

## Git Push Protocol
Use Desktop Commander (`mcp__Desktop_Commander__start_process`) to run `git push` — it executes as `ambermin` with Keychain access.

```zsh
cd ~/LocalStorm/Workspace/DevProjects/house_of_rose/house-of-rose-site && git push origin main
```

## Preferences
- Strict TypeScript — no `any`, use interfaces + generics
- GROQ queries live in `packages/web/src/lib/queries.ts`
- Sanity client/helpers live in `packages/web/src/lib/sanity.ts`
- Create files in place — don't just output code blocks
- Explain the *why* and *how*, skip pleasantries
